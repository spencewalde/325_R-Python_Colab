My name is Domino and I am available for adoption!<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good Samaritan on September 6, 2020. I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on September 22, 2020. This means that my adoption fee has been waived.  However, please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>I love to cuddle! I will gladly curl up on laps for a short nap. I am always happy to interact when invited and I often seek out people to play with me. I follow my humans around the house and I want to be in the room as you. I am not overly vocal, but I do like to talk at mealtimes, when I am asking for play or pets, and sometimes when I am spoken to. Despite my ""older"" age, I am still energetic and require active play with a human at least once a day. <p/><p/>My fur is very soft, especially my Maine Coon-ish ruff. I love to chase toy mousies, wand toys with feathers, and laser dots. While in foster care, I never scratched the furniture after an application of scratch deterrent spray and introduction of a cardboard scratcher. I also used my litter box perfectly. <p/><p/>My caregivers have learned that I DO NOT do well with other cats in the home and need to be the only cat in an adult only home. <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)   Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (FIV)- FIV is a viral infection that is transmitted between cats usually through fighting.  This is a lifelong infection with no cure.  FIV cats can have shorter lifespans, however many of them can live many years in good health with proper management and care.  Please refer to the information handout provided.<p/><p/>2)   Dental with extractions on 9/15/20.  He may need additional dental care in the future.<p/><p/>3)   Cystic mass on right hip.  Diagnostics not performed.<p/><p/>",RED

My name is Maxwell and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by my previous owner on March 3, 2020 because they were moving. I lived in a home with another other cat. My previous owner described me as shy, but loving. I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on 10/19/2020. This means that my adoption fee has been waived.  However, please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost, and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space. I am an adventure kitty who would love to go on walks with a harness outside to get enrichment!<p/><p/>MEDICAL WAIVER<p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)     Dental cleaning on 3/24/20.  There is moderate gingivitis and gingival recession.  Future dental care may be needed.<p/><p/>2)    FeLV- This cat tested positive for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV).  Cats infected with this virus may have an active, or latent infection.  Active infection leads to immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to disease, or lymphosarcoma.  Infected cats are expected to have a decreased lifespan and will require additional veterinary care.  However, with care, these cat may have a good quality of life for months to years.  FeLV is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  For this reason, this cat should be kept as a single cat or with other FeLV positive cats.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p/><p/>3)  Lymphoid hyperplasia, unknown cause.  This condition may be related to dental disease, fleas, or other underlying conditions.  There is no indication of neoplasia at this time but is concern due to FeLV status.<p/><p/>4)  This cat has had chronic diarrhea.  A abdominal ultrasound showed thickened intestines, indicating either inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal cancer.  A biopsy would be needed for further diagnostics.  We have started him on oral prednisilone to see if that improves the diarrhea.<p/>",RED

My mind runs even faster than I do! I am looking for a family that will enjoy keeping my brain and body active and exercised. I am also very nervous with strangers and will sometimes try to act scary when I meet new people. I am looking for someone with a lot of patience to help me with my transition to my new home.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am an energetic dog who can take some time to warm up to new humans.

Sometimes I just like to be given good ear scratches and neck massages. <p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with small  dogs and cats, and recommend that I do not live in a home with children. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>I have been known to resource guard, meaning that I am displaying behavior that is intended to convince other dogs or humans to stay away from a particular treasure or ""resource."" The resources that I tend to guard are my people and home. If you take me home you will benefit from in-home guidance to help to manage and improve this behavior.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>",RED
